        <h4>Mariah</h4>
    <p>Meet Mariah, the founder of Cats Cats Tax. I found my passion for taxes after having my first daughter and learned to navigate the complex world 
        while making connections with my clients over the past few years. Before starting my own business, I worked as a tax professional at one of the 
        largest tax preparation chains, leading to valuable insights into the tax industry and helping me hone my skills. 
        </p>
        <p>I started Cats Cats Tax to offer a more personalized and affordable approach to tax preparation.
            Tax season is already stressful, and clients shouldnâ€™t have to worry about high preparation fees or corporate greed. 
            My goal is to provide clear, reliable services at a price that respects both your money and my time. 
            By working directly with my clients, I can offer the freedom and flexibility both you and I need, without sacrificing quality.
        </p>
