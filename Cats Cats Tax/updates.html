            <h5> 2025 Tax Rates </h5>
            <p> The IRS has released the new tax rates for 2025! </p>
            <h5>Increased Standard deduction: </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single: $15,000</li>
                    <li>Married Filing Jointly: $30,000</li>
                    <li>Head of Household: $22,500</li>
                </ul>
            <h6> What does this mean?</h6>
            <p> The standard deduction is the amount that taxpayers can subtract from their income before calculating their tax liability. The increased standard deduction means that more taxpayers will be able to reduce their taxable income, potentially resulting in a higher refunds! </p>
